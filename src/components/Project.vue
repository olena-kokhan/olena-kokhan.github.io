We developed the general concept of the event together with its visual identity.

For those who still prefer a printed one, it is still a hard task to impress a reader and attract his attention with a usual book. In book stores, there are hundreds of books and it is very likely that most of them will not be even noticed. What is the future of printed books? How can we make a book more visible? \"See it\" is a book concept that combines all valuable properties of a printed book and opens the door for the interaction between the reader and a book. It is a book that can attract the attention of a reader in a different unexpected way. Using the sensor integrated into the cover the book reacts to the motion around it and responds on it with a light (also integrated into the book spine). Therefore if a customer tries to reach a book near it, the ‘See it’ book will be definitely noticed and arouse interest in it.",
